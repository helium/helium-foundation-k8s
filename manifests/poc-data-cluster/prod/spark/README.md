# Helium's SparkApplications

These yaml files are specifications of SparkApplication jobs.  They encode SQL queries using the Spark engine.  These particular queries process input data from Helium's Bronze Delta Lake tables and produce output into the Silver tables.  These SparkApplication queries run as jobs in Helium's Kubernetes cluster.
